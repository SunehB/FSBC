# FSBC Building and Running the Project

1. In order to run you must have a Spotify API access token, which expires every hour (currently figuring out how to make sure it refreshes)
2. And the API key for N2YO calls
3. Run app.py from code editor
4. Press "Call Function" on the website
5. Terminal should display a song from the launch year of a Satellite directly above you!

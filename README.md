1) Project Description
   \t Our project will find the closest satellite to the users current location by querying the N2YO api. A song is then played which is related to that satelliteâ€™s country of origin (probably the national anthem of that country). The songs will be provided using the Spotify API. The list of satellites found will also be stored in a log for future reference so users can see a list of all seen satilies.

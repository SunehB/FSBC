1) Project Description: Our project will find the closest satellite to the users current location by querying the N2YO api. A song is then played which is related to that satelliteâ€™s country of origin (probably the national anthem of that country). The songs will be provided using the Spotify API. The list of satellites found will also be stored in a log for future reference so users can see a list of all seen satilies.

2) Product Requirements

   -Goal:
         - Create a web-interface that allows a user to see what satilites pass over them and play a song corresponding to that satilites country of origin.

   -Non-Goal:
         - The web-interface will not track satilites leaving the region above the querey. A new querey is only made when the previous song ends.
      -Non-Functional Requirements:
